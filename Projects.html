		this is one of my best and proudest achievement in programming and life in general. it took a lot of time and creativity to make this.
		this is something that was one my bucket list when i was younger and i finaly accomplished it. i did have a different website befor this 
		but with my new skills and better creative thinking i decided to improve it. i started this website from scratch and the outcome of it is awesome.
		this will always stick with me that i can do anything and i can solve all of lifes problems with small steps.

		this was a game i created for my voTech class to test our javascript skill so far. in about 3 weeks i created this mini text 
		adventure game. this game consist of functions and if then statement (like lots if them). also i learned about disabling and enabling buttons. something that helped me out so much in the combat system and the story. it took me a while longer to make the 
		css of this game. the game turned out good. there were a good amount of problems such as when i couldn't disable some buttons or when
		i couldn't figure out the battle buttons and other button. through a good amount of research and looking at my friends prototypes i
		ended up fixing most of the problems if not all. and that is what i'm most proud of, i found a solution to a problem.

		this is a small little project that would test our knowledge on random numbers and getting the value of an HTML input. this was 
		not my first attempt. this was one of many that i have thought of but this one was the better and simpler one.
		i had a small problem such as not being able to get a number value of the input. i did some research and found out that i needed to 
		change the input type to number for it to return a number value. that was the only problem other than that the game works smoothly
		and have gotten positive feedback from my teacher and other students.
